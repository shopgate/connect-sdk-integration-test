# Cart Empty
---

The Cart Empty component is shown inside the cart when no products are added to the cart. It does not take any props. It simply shows a nice little animated SVG image.

## Getting Started

```jsx
import Empty from 'Pages/Cart/components/Empty';

<Empty />
```

## Props

### goBackHistory (required)

_Type_: `function`  

The Cart Empty component shows a "Continue shopping" button. This prop delivers the callback function that is triggered by clicking on the button.

###### Usage:

```jsx
<Empty goBackHistory={() => { ... }}/>
```
